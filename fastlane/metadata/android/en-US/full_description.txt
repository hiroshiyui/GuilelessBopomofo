Hello, it's me, Guileless Bopomofo Keyboard.

I have implemented most features of libchewing (https://chewing.im/), to provide you a choice of Bopomofo software keyboard (aka input method editor).

* Unlike other similar products, though I don't have fuzzy, error-tolerance design, I do still have ability to predict possible phrases by context, and I do remember phrases from your typing history automatically.

* Besides the most common "DaChen", I also provide you "Hsu" & "E-Ten 26 keys" Bopomofo keyboard layouts.
