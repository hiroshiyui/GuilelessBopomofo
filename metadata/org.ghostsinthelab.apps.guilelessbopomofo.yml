Summary: A simple Bopomofo software keyboard (input method editor) for typing Hanyu
Description: |-
    Hello, it's me, Guileless Bopomofo Keyboard.

    I have implemented most features of libchewing (http://chewing.im/),
    to provide you a choice of Bopomofo software keyboard
    (aka input method editor).

    * Unlike other similar products, though I don't have fuzzy, error-tolerance design, I do still have ability to predict possible phrases by context, and I do remember phrases from your typing history automatically.

    * Besides the most common "DaChen", I also provide you "Hsu" & "E-Ten 26 keys" Bopomofo keyboard layouts.
